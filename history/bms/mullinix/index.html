<h1>Burse and Mary Jane "Janie" Mullinix</h1>

<p>
Tom Burse Mullinix, Sr. and Mary Jane Stoker Mullinix, parents of
Selby Hartford Mullinix, and adopted son, T. B. Mullinix, Jr.  T. B. was
the biological child of John Hardister and Tenner Mullinix Hardister,
(sister of Tom Burse Mullinix, Sr).  Burse and Janie Mullinix adopted
T. B. before he was a year old.  The above are grandparents of Bonnie
Mullinix Springer, Ned (Edward Nelson) Mullinix, and Barry Thomas
Mullinix.  Bonnie and Barry are members of Stony Hill UMC.
</p>

<p>
I use to get a "big kick" out of saying I had three sets of grandparents.
Folk would look at me as if I were crazy.  But I did have three sets of
grandparents:  the Mullinix ones, the Cranford ones, and the Hardister
ones.  Dad's biological father remarried.  And we visited with he and his
wife, Mary, and the children from that union rather frequently in my
earlier years.

<p>
"Daddy Burse" and Mother Janie", as affectionally called by their
grandchildren were what I refer to on many occasions about dear folk,
as "good people".  "Daddy Burse" was a farmer and did some saw
milling as a means of livelihood for his family.  "Daddy Burse" had a
keen sense of humor, and could "spin a yarn a mile long".  Any event
told by him was different every time he told it and we all laughed again
and again.  And did he ever like to fish, oh yes!
</p>

<p>
"Mother Janie" was a homemaker, and made the best ginger snaps and
fried apple pies you could ever put in your mouth, as well as homemade
noodles.
</p>

<p>
Their chickens "ran free of the place" so gathering eggs could be a
challenge.  Also, they did not have "indoor plumbing" in my earlier
years, which was challenge of another sort.  And they had big garden
some distance from their home, and if you happen to be around at this
time of year, well you spent your time in the garden as well. I can recall
sitting on their porch with green beans, everywhere it seemed, and
stringing and breaking them all day long.  And since my hands were
small, I got to wash all the jars for the canning.
</p>

<p>
For whatever reason, mainly I think because daughters seem to be
closer to their mother's parents, I was, however, very fond of my
Mullinix grandparents and have fond memories of them as well.

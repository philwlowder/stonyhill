<h1>T.B. Jr. and Lucille Mullinix</h1>

<p>
T. B. Mullinix, Jr. and Lucille Cranford Mullinix, parents of Bonnie
Jean Mullinx Springer, Ned (Edward Nelson) Mullinix and Barry
Thomas Mullinix.  T. B. and Lucille were married October 19, 1934 in
the living room of Lucille's parents home, Bon and Ardelia Stoker
Cranford.  T. B. and Lucille purchased the W. W. Moffett house in
1935.  The Moffetts had lived in the house approximately ten years, they
were a British couple, and they returned to their native home.

<p>
T. B. was a chauffer for the Moffetts for a few years, and traveled
extensively with them, going places and seeing things he would not have
seen normally.  He and Lucille worked in the local mill early in their
marriage.  T. B., then worked for Alcoa, and Standard Oil of New
Jersey, now known as Exxon, from where he retired in the early 1970's.
</p>

<p>
Lucille was a homemaker of the truest sort.  She worked outside her
home only a short time, and did all necessary to be home for her
children, to be available for her parents and in-laws, do much for her
church, and others.  Lucille was an accomplished seamstress, and did
handwork of any kind.  (I have tried all my life to be as much like her as
possible.  I have failed miserably at the sewing machine and the
handwork, and probably all the other as well.)
</p>

<p>
Lucille contacted tuberculosis in early 1946.  She was pregnant with
Barry at this time.  From April-mid-December 1946, Lucille was a
resident at a state sanatorium near Aberdeen, North Carolina.  Bonnie
resided with the Cranford grandparents, hence her strong affection for
them, while Ned resided with the Mullinix grandparents.  They lived
with their grandparents during the weekdays, as T. B. traveled with his
work, being with him on the weekends, doing the Sunday afternoon
visits with Lucille.  Barry was born in June 1946, and lived with Aunt
Nell (Lucille's sister) until Lucille was able to come home in mid-
December 1946, and the family was united.  Lucille always had a strong
faith, as did T. B., and it served all of them well at this unusual time in
their lives.  The family was different from that time on.
</p>


<p>
We certainly did not have a lot of money, but I don't recall not having
everything we really needed.  I had "one of a kind" nice clothes all the
time my mother lived, because she made them for me.  She was a very
classy lady, with a lot of style about her, and quite attractive I must say.
She was very dear to my heart, and it nearly broke in two when she died
as the result of an automobile accident in February 1964.
</p>


<p>
Lucille was 49 years old when she died.  She and T. B. would have been
married 30 years in October 1964.
</p>


<p>
In time, (1972), T. B. remarried.  He married Deane Green Little, an
Exxon employee whose husband had died from cancer.  They were
married nearly 26 years when Tom (as Deane referred to him) died in
March, 1999, just days before his 88th birthday.
</p>

<p>
Dad was a dear soul, a wonderful father, and a truly loving grandfather
to his 9 grandchildren.
</p>

<p>
It took me some time to realize I was raised in what Henry and I refer to
as "God's Country", and for me to appreciate how and where I was
raised, and by whom.  Life is a journey, and I have been blessed with
many "good people" on my journey.

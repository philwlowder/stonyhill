<h2>Early Church Members</h2>
<p>The first records mentioned the names, Atkins, Bell, Blalock, Forrest, Freeman, Huckabee, Kirk, Manor, Melton, Rush, Smith, and Stoker. Most of these families have descendants in our church today.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Arthur F. Atkins</span> (1810-1892) was an outstanding member and preacher of Stony Hill. He married Harriet Forrest (my great great great Aunt). His second wife was Martha Elliott. He was a firm believer in no unnecessary action on Sunday. He was half through shaving on a Saturday night, when his cow got out. He chased her until midnight. It wa then the Sabbath and he had not finished shaving. He preached at Stony Hill with only one-half of his face shaved (my mother told me this story).</p>
<p><span class="bold">The Bells</span> have had a prominent place in Stony Hill down through the years. Preacher Ben Bell was reported receiving members into the church in 1831. He is the forefather of the Kirk, Bell and Shaver families. His daughter Martha married George Kirk. A descendent of this family, J. C. Bell was a former Sunday school superintendent. June Shaver served also as superintendent His son Robert Vickers Shaver played the piano.</p>

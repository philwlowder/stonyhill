<h2>Sunrise Service</h2>
<p>Rev. N.C. Williams, Jr. established the Easter sunrise service in 1946. The service was sponsored jointly by the four churches on the Albemarle Circuit. This was the first sunrise service in Stanly County. There were thousands of people in attendance. An ambulance, doctor and a nurse were there to attend any one who might become ill. It was at this time that Paul Kirk gave the land behind the church to be used as a parking lot for this service. The lot was full of cars. The church parking lot was full and cars were parked along the John I. Kirk road and also the church road.</p>

<h2>Homecoming 1951</h2>
<p>Rev. J. C. Freeman chose <span class="italic">'Coming Home'</span> as the theme for his homecoming service in 1951. Rev. Ed Kirk a descendant of George and Martha came home to deliver an able message on coming home. The church was overflowing with people who had come home for the special service. To further emphasize the coming home theme, Rev. Freeman took into the church membership Harry and Alberta Boggan. We were coming home after being away for five years. In the afternoon most of the time was spent reading the old church rolls and remembering the various places the congregation had worshiped in the last one hundred and twenty five years. It was at this time Mr. Freeman made the statement that he hoped the stepping-stone could be brought <span class="italic">home</span> to its present site. This stone was used by the ladies of the first church to mount their horses. Mrs. Branson Shaver of Albemarle attended this homecoming service and wrote an article entitled <span class="italic">The Stony Hill Stepping Stone is Coming Home</span> The article was published in the Stanly News and Press. The stone was brought home in 1954 and placed in front of the church.</p>

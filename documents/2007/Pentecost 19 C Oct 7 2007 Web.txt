*THE APOSTLES' CREED  7
Response to the Word of God
I believe in God, the Father Almighty, creator of heaven and earth. 
I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord, who was
conceived by The Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary,
suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died and was
buried: he descended to the dead. On the third day he rose
again: he ascended into heaven, is seated at the right hand
of the Father, and will come again to judge the living and
the dead.  I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic
church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins,
the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting.
Amen.

"How Sweet The Name Of Jesus Sounds "

		How sweet the Name of Jesus Sounds in a believer's ear. 
	It soothes his sorrows, heals his wounds, and drives away his fear.
	Jesus , my Shepherd, brother, friend, my prophet, priest, and king. 
	My Lord, my life my way, my end, accept the praise I bring.

Stony Hill has joined the Conference Media Center. Classes
and groups can now borrow those expensive sets of Bible
study books and videos at no cost.

Holy Communion is one of two sacraments Protestant churches
celebrate, the other being baptism. Jesus himself instituted
(established) both of these sacraments. His "words of
institution" can be found in scripture in four places:
Matthew 26:26-29; Mark 14:22-25; Luke 22:19-21; and repeated
by the Apostle Paul in I Corinthians 11:23-29.

World Communion Sunday, the first Sunday in October, has
been celebrated since 1939. This day has taken on new depth
of meaning in a world where globalization often has
undermined peace and justice, when fear divides the peoples
of God's earth. On this day we celebrate our oneness in
Christ, the Prince of Peace, in the midst of the world we
are called to serve - a world ever more in need of
peacemaking. - World Council of Churches

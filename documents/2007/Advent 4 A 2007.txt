Romans 1:7
	To a all God's beloved who are called to be saints.
	Grace to you and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.

* CALL TO WORSHIP
Matthew 1:18-25
	Joseph, the husband of Mary and foster father of Jesus Christ,
	Is a sign to the Church of faithful obedience to the will of God.
	As we prepare to commemorate the birth of Christ, let us pray that we, like Joseph, 
	May hear God's word and respond in obedient faith to the coming of Christ.

* OPENING PRAYER


Lord, we come to you as ordinary people, seeking to know and serve an amazing God. 
Forgive us for the times we have thought of you in our heads but failed to love you 
with our hearts. Out of our desire for success we have given our energies to pursue 
many things. We have set our hearts on accomplishments and lost your intimate 
presence. Teach us to speak and act out of love, and to do what is right. Make us 
willing to live in the shadows, to allow your life to be seen in us. And, Jesus, in this 
season we want to be careful to say, You are enough. Amen.

*THE APOSTLES' CREED  7
Response to the Word of God
I believe in God, the Father Almighty, creator of heaven and earth. 
I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord, who was conceived by The Holy 
Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died and 
was buried: he descended to the dead. On the third day he rose again: he ascended 
into heaven, is seated at the right hand of the Father, and will come again to judge the 
living and the dead. 
I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic church, the communion of saints, 
the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting. Amen.

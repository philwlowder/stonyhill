PRELUDE AND LIGHTING OF THE CANDLES

*CHORAL CALL TO WORSHIP
"Holy Spirit, Thou Art Welcome"

	Holy Spirit, thou art welcome in this place,
	Holy Spirit, thou art welcome in this place;
	Omnipotent father of mercy and grace,
	Thou art welcome in this place.

WELCOME, ANNOUNCEMENTS, AND PASSING OF THE PEW PADS

*GREETING
Luke 10:11, 20
	The Kingdom of God has come near.
	Rejoice that your names are written in heaven.

* CALL TO WORSHIP

		A kind word opens a closed flower.
		A soul-deep prayer lifts the clouds. 
		A generous gift loosens hardened hearts.
		A quite deed catches another's attention.
		A heartfelt forgiveness releases new possibilities.
		Each act of love, each measure of care
		Weaves another strand in God's kingdom
		And causes the heart to sing.

*HYMN  121
"The Church in the Wildwood"

* OPENING PRAYER

based on Luke 10:25-37
Lord God, your mercy delights us, and the world longs for your loving care.
Hear the cries of everyone in need, and turn our hearts to love our neighbors
with the love of your son Jesus Christ, our Savior and Lord. Amen.

*THE PEACE  8	The peace of the Lord be with you always. And also with you.
                Let us greet one another with signs of God's
				reconciliation and love.

WORSHIP WITH TITHES AND OFFERINGS

*DOXOLOGY
"Give Thanks"
GIVE THANKS
	Give thanks with a grateful heart; Give thanks to the Holy One;
	Give thanks because he's given Jesus Christ, his Son. (Repeat)
	And now let the weak say, "I am strong." Let the poor say, "I am rich,"
	Because of what the Lord has done for us. (Repeat)  Give thanks.

*HYMN  54
"I Need Thee Every Hour"


*THE APOSTLES' CREED  7

I believe in God, the Father Almighty, creator of heaven and earth. 
I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord,
who was conceived by The Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary,
suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died and was buried:
he descended to the dead. On the third day he rose again: he ascended
into heaven, is seated at the right hand of the Father, and will come
again to judge the living and the dead. I believe in the Holy Spirit,
the holy catholic church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins,
the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting. Amen.

*HYMN  153
"Love, Mercy, and Grace"

*BLESSING  11

* CHORAL BENEDICTION
"He Is Lord"
HE IS LORD
	He is Lord, He is Lord. He has risen from the dead and He is Lord.
	Every knee shall bow, Every tongue confess That Jesus Christ is Lord.

* CALL TO WORSHIP

Out of the blue God comes to us. 
In the midst of turmoil Jesus walks toward us.
As darkness closes in, the Spirit lights a way for us.
Out of the blue, Jesus comes through.
When times are tough, God can be enough. As questions arise, the Spirit is wise.
Let us raise our voices in song. May our praise be loud and strong.

*THE APOSTLES' CREED  7

I believe in God, the Father Almighty, creator of heaven and earth. 
I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord, who was conceived by
The Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate,
was crucified, died and was buried: he descended to the dead. On the third day
he rose again: he ascended into heaven, is seated at the right hand of the Father,
and will come again to judge the living and the dead. I believe in the Holy Spirit,
the holy catholic church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins,
the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting. Amen.

* CHORAL BENEDICTION
"He Is Lord"
HE IS LORD
	He is Lord, He is Lord. He has risen from the dead and He is Lord.
	Every knee shall bow, Every tongue confess That Jesus Christ is Lord.

* CALL TO WORSHIP

Isaiah 65:17-25
	God is about to create new heavens and a new earth.
	The former things shall not be remembered or come to mind.
	But we will be glad and rejoice forever in what God is creating.
	Jerusalem will be God's joy. And we, the inhabitants, will be God's delight.
	We will rejoice in the New Jerusalem, and we will be God's great joy.
	There shall be no more the sound of weeping or our cries of distress.
	No more will an infant live but a few days, or an older person not live out a lifetime.
	The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and while we are speaking, God will 
	hear. We have come to practice for that great day with sounds of worship and 
	thanksgiving.

	Amen.

*THE APOSTLES' CREED  7
Response to the Word of God
I believe in God, the Father Almighty, creator of heaven and earth. 
I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord, who was conceived by The Holy 
Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died and 
was buried: he descended to the dead. On the third day he rose again: he ascended 
into heaven, is seated at the right hand of the Father, and will come again to judge the 
living and the dead. 
I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic church, the communion of saints, 
the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting. Amen.

* CHORAL BENEDICTION
"Glorify Thy Name"



In 1 Thessalonians 5:1-11 Paul counsels the new disciples to be alert as in the daylight, for 
the day of the Lord will come swiftly and unexpectedly, and at a time unknown to 
humanity. Many early Christians believed that the course of world history would soon come 
to an end. Paul urges the Thessalonians not to live as people of the night, but soberly and 
expectantly. Whether they first die or remain alive they may look forward, not to God's 
wrath, but to a salvation that has been gained through Jesus. Paul's central point remains 
valid for us today. We do not know when the consummation of history will take place, but 
are to live always prepared for judgment.

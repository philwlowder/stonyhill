* CALL TO WORSHIP

Psalm 71:1-6  NRSV
	In you, O Lord, I take refuge; let me never be put to shame. 
	In your righteousness deliver and rescue me; incline your ear to me and save me.
	Be to me a rock of refuge, a strong fortress, to save me, for you are my rock and my
	fortress. Rescue me, O my God, from the hand of the wicked, from the grasp of the
	unjust and cruel. For you, O Lord, are my hope, my trust, O Lord, from my youth. 
	Upon you I have leaned from my birth; it was you who took me from my mother's womb.
	My praise is continually of you.

*HYMN  261
"Lord of the Dance"
LORD OF THE DANCE

* OPENING PRAYER

	O God, mighty and immortal, you know that as fragile creatures surrounded by
	great dangers, we cannot stand upright without you. Give us strength of mind and
	body, so that even when we suffer because of human sin, we may rise victorious
	through your son Jesus Christ, our Savior and Lord. Amen.

*THE PEACE  8		The peace of the Lord be with you always. 	And also with you.
					Let us greet one another with signs of God's reconciliation and love.

"O Master, Let Me Walk with Thee"
MARYTON

*THE APOSTLES' CREED  7

I believe in God, the Father Almighty, creator of heaven and earth. 
I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord, who was conceived by The Holy Spirit,
born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died and
was buried: he descended to the dead. On the third day he rose again: he ascended into heaven,
is seated at the right hand of the Father, and will come again to judge the living and the dead. 
I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic church, the communion of saints,
the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting. Amen.

*CHORAL CALL TO WORSHIP  328
"Surely the Presence of the Lord"


WELCOME, ANNOUNCEMENTS, AND PASSING OF THE PEW PADS

*GREETING
Adapted from Psalm 14
	Only the fool would say, "There is no God."
	We worship the God who looks down from heaven. 
	We rejoice because we know God's word is true:
	"Christ Jesus came to save us," Praise the Lord!

* CALL TO WORSHIP

Adapted from Luke 15
	God of the lost, God of the found,
	Our hearts are filled with thanksgiving that you care enough to seek us when we are lost.
	We are filled with gratitude that you are willing to seek us again and again,
	Every time we wander away because we are determined on our own direction,
	Every time we find ourselves alone because we are not paying attention,
	Every time we get left behind because we are too tired to keep up.
	God of the lost, God of the found, grant us the love to rejoice with each lost soul that is
	found, 	Remembering that others welcomed us when we were gathered in.

*HYMN  732
"Come, We that Love the Lord"
ST. THOMAS

* OPENING PRAYER


	Lord Jesus, who sought the lost sheep and brought it on your shoulder to your fold:
	Give to us a spirit of more rejoicing, that we may obtain the fullness of joy
	and be more earnestly devoted to following your way of life. We ask this of you in
	the unity of the blessed and holy Trinity, one God now and forever. Amen.

*THE PEACE  8		The peace of the Lord be with you always. 	And also with you.
					Let us greet one another with signs of God's reconciliation and love.

*THE APOSTLES' CREED  7

I believe in God, the Father Almighty, creator of heaven and earth. 
I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord, who was conceived by The Holy Spirit,
born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died and was buried:
he descended to the dead. On the third day he rose again: he ascended into heaven,
is seated at the right hand of the Father, and will come again to judge the living and the dead. 
I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins,
the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting. Amen.

MARCHING TO ZION

*BLESSING  11

"I Love You, Lord"

	I love you, Lord, and I lift my voice, To worship you O my soul rejoice.
	Take joy my king in what you hear. Let me be a sweet, sweet sound in your ear.

"What I gave I have, what I spent I had; and what I left I lost." ~ Robert of Doncaste

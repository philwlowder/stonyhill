	the wonder of our country's story: 
	We give you thanks, O God.
	For leaders in nation and state, and for those who in days past and in these present 
	times have labored for the commonwealth:
	We give you thanks, O God.
	For those who in all times and places have been true and brave, and in the world's 
	common ways have lived upright lives and ministered to their fellows:
	We give you thanks, O God.
	For those who served their country in its hour of need, and especially for those who 
	gave even their lives in that service:
	We give you thanks, O God.

Almighty God, as we remember these your servants, remembering with gratitude 
their courage and strength, we hold before you those who mourn them. Look upon the 
bereaved with your mercy. As this day brings them memories of those they have lost, 
may it also bring your consolation and the assurance that their loved ones are alive 
now and forever in your living presence. Amen.

*THE APOSTLES' CREED  7
Response to the Word of God
I believe in God, the Father Almighty, creator of heaven and earth. 
I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord, who was conceived by The Holy 
Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died and 
was buried: he descended to the dead. On the third day he rose again: he ascended 
into heaven, is seated at the right hand of the Father, and will come again to judge the 
living and the dead. 
I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic church, the communion of saints, 
the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting. Amen.

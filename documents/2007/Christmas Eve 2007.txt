*GREETING
Luke 2:10
L:	Do not be afraid; for see I am bringing you good news of a 
great joy for all the people:
C:	To you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, who is 
	the Messiah, the Lord.

*CALL TO WORSHIP

L	Silent night, holy night,
C	Behold the wonder, born in light.
L	Born a child, yet a king.
C	A promise fulfilled, the angels sing.
L	Sing of love, sing of life,
C	The Prince of Peace shall end all strife.

*OPENING PRAYER
Holy Child, bring your gentle light to the hidden corners of our 
lives so our fears seem small and powerless. Touch our wounds 
and lift the hurts and resentments, so our words may be clear 
and our actions, kind. Draw close to those who celebrate this 
holy season without a special loved one. Be near to those whose 
failing health dims the angels' chorus. Holy Child of Bethlehem, 
be born in us tonight. Amen.

WORSHIP WITH TITHES AND OFFERINGS

*PRAYER FOR ILLUMINATION  6

Lord, open our hearts and minds by the power of your Holy 
Spirit, that, as the Scriptures are read and your Word pro-
claimed, we may hear with joy what you say to us today. Amen.

GOSPEL LESSON

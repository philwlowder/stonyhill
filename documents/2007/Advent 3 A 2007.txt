"There's Something about That Name"


WELCOME, PASSING OF THE PEW PADS, AND ANNOUNCEMENTS

* GREETING
Zechariah 2:10
	Sing and rejoice, O daughter Zion! 
	For lo, I will come and dwell in your midst, says the Lord.

* CALL TO WORSHIP

	A hunger of the heart, a sound in the night;
	A baby's low cry, a new star so bright.
	The smell of pine, and Christmas carols sung;
	Then and now, something is in the air.
	We hasten to be ready, for love and joy are here.
	A child in a manger, a gift from God who cares.

* HYMN
"Star Child"
STAR CHILD
	1	Star Child, Earth Child, go between of God,
								Love Child, Christ Child, heaven's lighting rod,
	2	Street child, beat child, no place left to go, 
								Hurt child, used child, no one wants to know, 
	3	Grown child, old child, memory full of years, 
								Sad child, lost child, story told in tears, 
	4	Spared child, spoiled child, having, wanting more, 
								Wise child, faith child, knowing what's in store, 
	5	Hope for peace child, God's stupendous sign, 
								Down to earth child, Star of stars that shine, 
	Refrain: 		This year, this year, let the day arrive when 
								Christmas comes to everyone, everyone alive.


* OPENING PRAYER


God of manger and star, let us enter your story once again, and find ourselves 
kneeling with the shepherds, singing with the angels, and worshiping with the Magi. 
Touch our hearts with the wonder of birth and the depths of your love. Speak to us in 
word and song, and lift us to the realms of glory. Amen.

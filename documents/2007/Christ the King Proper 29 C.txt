*THE APOSTLES' CREED  7
Response to the Word of God
I believe in God, the Father Almighty, creator of heaven and earth. 
I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord, who was conceived by The Holy 
Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died and 
was buried: he descended to the dead. On the third day he rose again: he ascended 
into heaven, is seated at the right hand of the Father, and will come again to judge the 
living and the dead. 
I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic church, the communion of saints, 
the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting. Amen.

"Glorify Thy Name"

Christ the King is the last Sunday of the church year. This day completes our Christian 
journey through the life of Christ, which began with the preparation for the birth of Jesus in 
Advent. Kings are absolute rulers: they attain power by raising and leading armies into war 
against other countries. Jesus' war was not against people or against a country, but against 
sin, death, and the power of the Devil. By his death, resurrection, and ascension, Jesus won 
the war against evil. Today Christians recognize and worship Christ as king of heaven and 
earth for all time without challenge and without end. 	The title is found in various forms in 
scripture: King Eternal (1 Tim. 1:17), King of Israel (John 1:49), King of the Jews (Mt. 
27:11), King of kings (1 Tim 6:15; Rev. 19:16), King of the Ages (Rev. 15:3) and Ruler of 
the Kings of the Earth (Rev. 1:5).

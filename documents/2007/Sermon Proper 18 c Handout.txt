Luke 14:25-33
25 Now large crowds were traveling with him; and he turned and
said to them,
26 "Whoever comes to me and does not hate father and mother, wife
and children, brothers and sisters, yes, and even life itself, cannot be my
disciple.
27 Whoever does not carry the cross and follow me cannot be my
disciple.
28 For which of you, intending to build a tower, does not first sit
down and estimate the cost, to see whether he has enough to complete it?
29 Otherwise, when he has laid a foundation and is not able to finish, all who see
it will begin to ridicule him, 30 saying, 'This fellow began to build and was
not able to finish.'
31 Or what king, going out to wage war against another
king, will not sit down first and consider whether he is able with ten thousand
to oppose the one who comes against him with twenty thousand?
32 If he cannot, then, while the other is still far away, he sends a delegation and asks for the
terms of peace.
33 So therefore, none of you can become my disciple if you do
not give up all your possessions.

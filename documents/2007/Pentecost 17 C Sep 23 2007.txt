PRELUDE AND LIGHTING OF THE CANDLES

*CHORAL CALL TO WORSHIP  328
"Surely the Presence of the Lord"


WELCOME, ANNOUNCEMENTS, AND PASSING OF THE PEW PADS

*GREETING
Adapted from Psalm 14
	Only the fool would say, "There is no God."
	We worship the God who looks down from heaven. 
	We rejoice because we know God's word is true:
	"Christ Jesus came to save us," Praise the Lord!

* CALL TO WORSHIP


	Beams of sunlight causing our stained glass windows to shine.
	Surely this is the presence of the Lord.
	Flickering candles, bouquets of color and joyous music.
	Sights and sounds heightening 	our awareness of our wondrous Creator.
	Surely this is the presence of the Lord.
	Expectant hearts yearning for a word of blessing; eager lives seeking
	strength for each 	day; weary bodies longing for refreshing rest and quite peace.
	Surely this is the presence of the Lord.
	Watching and waiting, noticing and listening, open and hopeful.
	Surely this is the presence of the Lord.

*HYMN  398
"Jesus Calls Us"
GALILEE

* OPENING PRAYER


	Lord Jesus, you teach us to be faithful stewards of all life's resources. We are
	grateful that though our efforts are often feeble, our choices wasteful, our
	concern lacking, you have forgiven us. We spend so many precious days of our
	lives making, counting, and hoarding money, as if that were our ultimate security.
	We try to hide the extent of our sin, and when our eyes are opened, we make
	frantic, desperate efforts to salvage what we can of our depleted environment,
	our endangered relationships, and our health. In your mercy, forgive us, we pray.
	Amen.


*THE PEACE  8		The peace of the Lord be with you always. 	And also with you.
					Let us greet one another with signs of God's reconciliation and love.

*THE APOSTLES' CREED  7

I believe in God, the Father Almighty, creator of heaven and earth. 

I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord, who was conceived by The Holy Spirit,
born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified,
died and was buried: he descended to the dead. On the third day he rose again: he ascended into heaven,
is seated at the right hand of the Father, and will come again to judge the living and the dead. 

I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins,
the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting. Amen.

*HYMN  354

"I Love You, Lord"

	I love you, Lord, and I lift my voice, To worship you O my soul rejoice.
	Take joy my king in what you hear. Let me be a sweet, sweet sound in your ear.

"What I gave I have, what I spent I had; and what I left I lost." ~ Robert of Doncaste

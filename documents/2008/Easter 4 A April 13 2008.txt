*PRAYER


We pray to you, O God, in thanksgiving and gratitude for your sending us the
Good Shepherd to watch over us. Like those of old, we too often feel like sheep
that have been scattered. We have not listened to the shepherd who gently leads
us. Give us ears to hear his tender voice calling us, the voice that leads us to
abundant life. In the name of the Good Shepherd we pray. Amen.

*THE APOSTLES' CREED
7
I believe in God, the Father Almighty, creator of heaven and earth.
I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord, who was conceived by The
Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified,
died and was buried: he descended to the dead. On the third day he rose again: he
ascended into heaven, is seated at the right hand of the Father, and will come again
to judge the living and the dead.
I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic church, the communion of saints,
the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting. Amen.

STRONG FAITH
My faith still holds on to the Christ of Calvary,

My faith still holds on to the Christ of Calvary.

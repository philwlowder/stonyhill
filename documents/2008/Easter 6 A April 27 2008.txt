WELCOME AND ANNOUNCEMENTS

*GREETING

	The Grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you. 		And also with you.
	The risen Christ is with us!						Praise the Lord!
*CALL TO WORSHIP


	We are gathered together to worship the God who has called us to love God.
	And the God who has asked us to follow God's direction.
	We are invited to worship God in the Spirit of truth. 
We do so, because we know the Spirit and the Spirit knows us. 
We are reminded that we are not alone. Because the Holy Spirit is among us, 
	Jesus is with God, and God is present. Let us rejoice that because he lives, we, too, 
shall live!

*PRAYER


Loving God, thank you for the Advocate-when we cannot express ourselves. 
Thank you for the Comforter-when sadness threatens to overwhelm us. Thank 
you for the Encourage-when we need to speak out. Thank you for the Defender-
when we face difficult conflicts. Thank you for the Exhorter-when we need to be 
reminded to speak with courage, justice, and truth. Thank you for the Helper-
when we need support in everyday living. Thank you for the Spirit-who abides in 
us and is with us forever. Amen.

"We Know that Christ Is Raised"

*THE APOSTLES' CREED
7
I believe in God, the Father Almighty, creator of heaven and earth.
I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord, who was conceived by The 
Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, 
died and was buried: he descended to the dead. On the third day he rose again: he 
ascended into heaven, is seated at the right hand of the Father, and will come again 
to judge the living and the dead. 
I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic church, the communion of saints, 
the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting. Amen.

Prelude and Lighting of the Candles

Reading for the 1st Sunday of Advent
L. Christ came to bring us salvation and has promised to come again.  Let us pray that  we may 
always be ready to welcome him.  That the keeping of Advent may open our hearts to God's 
love, that the light of Christ may penetrate the darkness of sin, that this wreath may constantly 
remind us to prepare for t he coming of Christ, that  the Christmas season may fill us with 
peace and joy as we strive to follow the example of Jesus.

P.  Loving God, your church joyfully awaits the coming of its Savior, who enlightens our 
hearts and dispels the darkness of ignorance and sin.  Pour forth your blessings upon us 
as we light the candles of this wreath.  May their light reflect the splendor of Christ, who 
is Lord, for ever and ever.  Amen.

L. Isaiah 60:2-3 "See the darkness covers the earth and thick darkness is over the peoples, but 
the LORD rises upon you and his glory appears over you.  Nations will come to your light, and 
kings to the brightness of your dawn.

P. We light this candle as a symbol of Christ our Hope.  May the light sent from God 
shine in the darkness to show us the way of salvation.  O come, O come, Emmanuel.

"The Holly and the Ivy"

Chorus:  The Holly and the Ivy, When they are both full grown,
Of all the trees that are in the wood, The holly bears the crown.

1. The rising of the sun____  And the running of the deer,
The playing of the merry organ, sweet singing of the choir.  Chorus

2. The holly bears a blossom, as white as lily flow'r ,
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ, To be our sweet Savior.  Chorus

3. The holly bears a berry, As red as any blood,
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ, to do poor sinners good.  Chorus

"O Christmas Tree"

O Christmas Tree! O Christmas Tree, You stand in God-made beauty!
O Christmas Tree, O Christmas Tree, You stand in God-made beauty!
Your boughs are green in summer's glow, and do not fade in winter's snow.
O Christmas Tree, O Christmas Tree, You stand in God-made beauty!

O Christmas Tree! O Christmas Tree, Much pleasure doth thou bring me!
O Christmas Tree, O Christmas Tree, Much pleasure doth thou bring me!
For ev'ry year the Christmas Tree, Brings to us all both joy and glee.
O Christmas Tree, O Christmas Tree, Much pleasure doth thou bring me!

O Christmas Tree! O Christmas Tree, Thy candles shine out brightly!
O Christmas Tree, O Christmas Tree, Thy candles shine out brightly!
Each bough doth hold its tiny light, Reminding us of Jesus Christ! 
O Christmas Tree, O Christmas Tree, Thy candles shine out brightly!

	Lord, make us your disciples, attentive to your Word, day and night. On our

suspicion seem to rule, we pray that you give us the humble patience necessary 
for reconciliation. May our churches commit themselves once more to pray for 
the full unity of all Christians, and our prayers be added to centuries of prayers 
"that all may be one." Amen.

* THE APOSTLES' CREED  7
Response to the Word of God
I believe in God, the Father Almighty, creator of heaven and earth.
I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord, who was conceived by The 
Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, 
died and was buried: he descended to the dead. On the third day he rose again: he 
ascended into heaven, is seated at the right hand of the Father, and will come again 
to judge the living and the dead. 
I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic church, the communion of saints, 
the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting. Amen.

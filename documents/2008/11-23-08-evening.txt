HONOR AND THANKSGIVING

Offer to God a sacrifice of thanksgiving.
Sing praise to the Lord, you, His godly ones, and give thanks to His
holy name.
Be glad in the Lord, you righteous ones and give thanks to His holy
name.
Give thanks to the Lord, for He is good, give thanks to the God of
gods, the Lord of lords, the God of heaven,
For His lovingkindness is everlasting.
Oh, give thanks to the Lord, call upon His name;
Make known His deeds among the peoples.
Seek the Lord and His strength; seek His face continually.
Remember His wonders which He has done, His marvels, and the
judgments uttered by His mouth.
And all the angels were standing around the throne,
And around the elders and four living creatures; and they fell on
their faces before the throne and worshipped God saying:
Blessing and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving
And honor and power and might
Be to our God, forever and ever!  Amen.
From selected verses in Psalms and Revelation 7:11-12

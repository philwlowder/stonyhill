WELCOME, ANNOUNCEMENTS, AND PASSING OF PEW PADS

*GREETING

	Grace and peace be with you, my brothers and sisters!
	Grace and peace be with you also.

*CALL TO WORSHIP


	God's harvest needs dedicated and skilled laborers!
	We want to answer the call of Christ.
	Even if the work is demanding and the hours long!
	We will need endurance. 	Those whom God calls, God also equips.
	But we cannot do such work alone!
	Strength beyond human measure comes when the whole church works together!

*HYMN  593
"Here I Am, Lord"
HERE I AM, LORD
*PRAYER  6


	Faithful God, We are here now, and we have come to serve. We can hardly 
	believe that you have given us life and salvation as a free gift in Jesus Christ! 
	You send us out with nothing at all and yet with everything we need – healing, 
	forgiveness, restoration, and resurrection. Make us worthy to be providers of 
	your love in this world. In your son's name we pray. Amen.

The Invitation Has Not Changed

*HYMN  389
"Freely, Freely"
FREELY, FREELY
*THE APOSTLES' CREED  7

I believe in God, the Father Almighty, creator of heaven and earth.
I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord, who was conceived by The 
Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, 
died and was buried: he descended to the dead. On the third day he rose again: he 
ascended into heaven, is seated at the right hand of the Father, and will come 
again to judge the living and the dead. 
I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic church, the communion of saints, 
the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting. Amen.

AN ORDER OF FAREWELL TO A PASTOR
I thank you, the members and friends of Stony Hill United Methodist Church, for 
the love and support you have shown me while I have ministered among you. 
I am grateful for the ways my leadership has been accepted. I ask forgiveness for the 
mistakes I have made. As I leave, I carry with me all that I have learned here.

We receive your thankfulness, offer forgiveness, and accept that you now leave 
to minister elsewhere. We express our gratitude for your time among us. 
We ask your forgiveness for our mistakes. Your influence on our faith and 
faithfulness will not leave us with your departure.

	I accept your gratitude and forgiveness, and I forgive you, trusting that our time 
together and our parting are pleasing to God. I release you from turning to me and 
depending on me. I encourage your continuing ministry here. and will pray for you and 
for your new pastor, Lanny Lancaster.

Let us pray. Eternal God, whose steadfast love for us is from everlasting to 
everlasting; we give you thanks for cherished memories and commend one another 
into your care as we move in new directions. Keep us one in your love forever, 
through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

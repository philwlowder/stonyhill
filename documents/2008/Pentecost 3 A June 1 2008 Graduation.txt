*GREETING

	The Grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
	And also with you.
	The risen Christ is with us.
	Praise the Lord.

*CALL TO WORSHIP


	God gives us one day at a time:
	Long enough for laughter to follow any tears;
	Deep enough for prayer and silence to dance together;
	Time enough to help someone in need;
	Plenty of time to notice beauty and praise the Maker;
	Sufficient time to build a bridge of forgiveness or tear down a wall of resentment;
	The time to embrace friends, smile at strangers, play with children, sing praise to God.
	Praise God for this day we are given, a day to rejoice and be glad.

*THE APOSTLES' CREED
7
I believe in God, the Father Almighty, creator of heaven and earth.
I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord, who was conceived by The 
Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, 
died and was buried: he descended to the dead. On the third day he rose again: he 
ascended into heaven, is seated at the right hand of the Father, and will come again 
to judge the living and the dead. 
I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic church, the communion of saints, 
the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting. Amen.

those less fortunate. Receptacles are in the narthex and in the hall outside the choir loft.

Flowers are given to the glory of God in honor of our graduates by Missy Archer.

Community is first and foremost a gift of the Holy Spirit, not built upon mutual 
compatibility, shared affection, or common interests but upon having received 
the same divine breath, having been given a heart set aflame by the same divine 
fire, and having been embraced by the same divine love. - Henri Nouwen

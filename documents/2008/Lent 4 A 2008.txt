1.	O how he loves you and me! O how he loves you and me! He gave his life, what
	more could he give?

Ephesians 5:8
	Once you were darkness, but now in the Lord you are light.

* CALL TO WORSHIP
Psalm 23
The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures:
He leadeth me beside the still waters. He restoreth my soul:
He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.
Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.
Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies;
Thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life,
and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever.

* THE APOSTLES' CREED  7
Response to the Word of God
I believe in God, the Father Almighty, creator of heaven and earth.
I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord, who was conceived by The Holy
Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died and
was buried: he descended to the dead. On the third day he rose again: he ascended
into heaven, is seated at the right hand of the Father, and will come again to judge the
living and the dead.
I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic church, the communion of saints,
the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting. Amen.

STRONG FAITH
My faith still holds on to the Christ of Calvary, O blessed Rock of Ages cleft for me.
I gladly place my trust in things I cannot see. My faith still holds on to the Christ of
Calvary.

*Please stand as you are able.

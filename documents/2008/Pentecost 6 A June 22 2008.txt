*CALL TO WORSHIP

Psalm 130
	Out of the depths I cry to you, O Lord. Lord, hear my voice! 
	Let your ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications! 
	If you, O Lord, should mark iniquities, Lord, who could stand? 
	But there is forgiveness with you, so that you may be revered. 
	I wait for the Lord, my soul waits, and in his word I hope; my soul waits for the Lord, 
	More than those who watch for the morning, more than those who watch for the 
	morning. 
	O Israel, hope in the Lord! For with the Lord there is steadfast love, and with him is 
	great power to redeem. 
	It is he who will redeem Israel from all its 	iniquities.

*PRAYER  6

Cranmer's Collect for Purity
	Almighty God, unto whom all hearts are open, all desires known, and from 
	whom no secrets are hid: Cleanse the thoughts of our hearts by the inspiration 
	of thy Holy Spirit, that we may perfectly love thee, and worthily magnify thy 
	holy name; through Christ our Lord. Amen.

*HYMN  367
"He Touched Me"
HE TOUCHED ME

A Covenant Prayer in the Wesleyan Tradition	607
I am no longer my own, but thine.
Put me to what thou wilt.
Rank me with whom thou wilt;
Put me to doing, put me to suffering;
Let me be employed for thee or laid aside for thee,
Exalted for thee or brought low for thee;
Let me be full, let me be empty;
Let me have all things, let me have nothing;
I freely and heartily yield all things
To thy pleasure and disposal.

And now, O glorious and blessed God,
Father, Son and Holy Spirit,
Thou art mine, and I am thine.
So be it.
And the covenant which I have made on earth,
Let it be ratified in heaven.
Amen.

* CHORAL BENEDICTION
"Change My Heart, O God"
CHANGE MY HEART
	Change my heart O God; Make it ever true 
	Change my heart O God; May I be like you.
	You are the potter; I am the clay. Mold me and make me; This is what I pray 


Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful. Do not judge, and you will not 
be judged; do not condemn, and you will not be condemned. Forgive, and 
you will be forgiven; give, and it will be given to you. A good measure, 
pressed down, shaken together, running over, will be put into your lap; for 
the measure you give will be the measure you get back.- Luke 6:36-38

*CHORAL CALL TO WORSHIP
"He Is Here"
Kirk Talley
	He is here, hallelujah, he is here, amen!

*GREETING

	Grace and peace be with you, my brothers and sisters!
	Grace and peace be with you also.

*CALL TO WORSHIP


	All creation sings this day - waves resound in praise;
	Trees sway with joy; flowers bloom with laughter.
	All creation shouts for joy, for families and friends are gathering,
	Hearts are saying "yes" to God, and the community of faith is expanding its 
circle.
	All creation rejoices - sun glows with heavenly light;
	Wind whispers prayers of thanks; earth warms to bring forth spring delights, 
and we join the chorus of saints and stars in praising God.

*HYMN  77

"How Great Thou Art"
HOW GREAT THOU ART
*PRAYER  6


	Almighty God, to you all hearts are open, all desires known, and from you no 
	secrets are hidden. Cleanse the thoughts of our hearts by the inspiration of your 
	Holy Spirit, that we may perfectly love you, and worthily magnify your holy 
	name, through Christ our Lord. Amen.

"Great Is Thy Faithfulness"
FAITHFULNESS
*THE APOSTLES' CREED  7

I believe in God, the Father Almighty, creator of heaven and earth.
I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord, who was conceived by The 
Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, 
died and was buried: he descended to the dead. On the third day he rose again: he 
ascended into heaven, is seated at the right hand of the Father, and will come again 
to judge the living and the dead. 
I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic church, the communion of saints, 
the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting. Amen.

We welcome Susan Jacobs, our guest speaker, to Stony Hill this morning. It is good to 
have her back with us again.

Prayer is not a way of making use of God; prayer is a way of offering ourselves to God 
in order that God should be able to make use of us. It may be that one of our great faults 
in prayer is that we talk too much and listen too little. When prayer is at its highest we 
wait in silence for God's voice to us; we linger in his presence for his peace and his 
power to flow over us and around us; we lean back in his everlasting arms and feel the 
serenity of perfect security in him. ... William Barclay (1907-1978), The Plain Man's 
Book of Prayers [1959], Introduction

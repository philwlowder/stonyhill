PRELUDE AND LIGHTING OF THE CANDLES

*CHORAL CALL TO WORSHIP
"He Is Here"
Kirk Talley
	He is here, hallelujah, he is here, amen! 
	He is here, holy, holy, I will bless his name again. 
	He is here, listen closely, hear him calling out your name.
	He is here you can touch him. You will never be the same

WELCOME AND ANNOUNCEMENTS

*GREETING

	The Grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you. 		And also with you.
	The risen Christ is with us!						Praise the Lord!
*CALL TO WORSHIP

Based on the Prophet Jonah
	Jonah, God is calling you to accountability!
	We have come to worship. There is no Jonah our midst!
	Jonah, God is calling you to accountability!
	We have gathered in this place with those like us to offer God thanks and praise.
	Jonah, God is calling you to accountability!
	We don't want to hear about "those people, out there." This is our time. Today we 
need encouragement for ourselves.
	Jonah, God is calling you to accountability! "Those people" are your assignment!
	Lord, the Jonah in us wants to run. But we have come to offer your praise. Feed 
us in this hour so that we might feed others when we leave.

*PRAYER


Lord, we don't want to take a message of your love and forgiveness to those who 
have hurt or oppressed us. We really don't want to ask for forgiveness for our 
own sins, because it makes us feel bad. But, our own sin is plainly before us. 
Forgive us, we pray. Restore us to your divine favour so that we might go and 
spread your love. Amen.

*THE APOSTLES' CREED
7
I believe in God, the Father Almighty, creator of heaven and earth.
I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord, who was conceived by The 
Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, 
died and was buried: he descended to the dead. On the third day he rose again: he 
ascended into heaven, is seated at the right hand of the Father, and will come again 
to judge the living and the dead. 
I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic church, the communion of saints, 
the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting. Amen.

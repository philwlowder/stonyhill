O Great Spirit! Watch over us as we begin this day.
Protect us as we live in your care. Give us bounty and hold us from harm.

We hold our Mother Earth close to our hearts and wish her goodness.
We thank you for your love!

God of the mountains and hills, make me tall and strong.
Tall enough and strong enough to right some wrong.
God of the stars, make me steadfast and sure.
God of every lake and stream, flow through my life and make me clean.
God of the trees and woods, keep me fresh and pure.
God of the rain, wash from my life all dirt and stain. Pure and strong let me remain.
God of seed and soil, plant in my heart Thy love.
God of the darkness and day, through shadows or light, be my stay. Guide thou my way.
God of the radiant sun, light Thou my life. God of glorious dawn, make each day a fresh start.

Prayer of the Day														        Ross Efird
"O, Great Spirit" by Chief Yellow Lark, a Blackfoot Indian
O, Great Spirit, whose voice I hear in the winds and whose breath gives life to the 
world, hear me. I come before you, one of your many children. I am weak and small, I 
need your strength and wisdom. Let me walk in beauty and make my eyes ever behold 
the red and purple sunset; my ears sharp so I may hear your voice. Make me wise, so I 
may learn the things you have taught my people, the lessons you have hidden under 
every rock and leaf. I seek strength, not to be superior to my brothers, but to be able 
to fight my greatest enemy-myself. Make me ready to come to you with clean hands 
and straight eyes, so whenever life fades, like the fading sunset, my spirit will come to 
you without shame.

* THE APOSTLES' CREED  7
Response to the Word of God
I believe in God, the Father Almighty, creator of heaven and earth.
I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord, who was conceived by The Holy 
Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died and 
was buried: he descended to the dead. On the third day he rose again: he ascended 
into heaven, is seated at the right hand of the Father, and will come again to judge the 
living and the dead. 
I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic church, the communion of saints, 
the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting. Amen.

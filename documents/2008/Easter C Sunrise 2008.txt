GREETING

	Alleluia! Christ is risen!
	He is risen indeed! Alleluia!

"Up from the Grave He Arose"
CHRIST AROSE
	Low in the grave He lay, Jesus my Savior, 
	Waiting the coming day, Jesus my Lord!

Refrain
Up from the grave he arose, with a mighty triumph o'er his foes,
	He arose a Victor from the dark domain,
	And he lives forever, with his saints to reign.
	He arose! He arose! Hallelujah! Christ arose!

	Vainly they watch his bed, Jesus my Savior;
	Vainly they seal the dead, Jesus my Lord!				Refrain
	Death cannot keep its Prey, Jesus my Savior; 
	He tore the bars away, Jesus my Lord!					Refrain

OPENING PRAYER

	Awesome God, your steadfast love endures always. As we 
	celebrate the promise of Easter, remind us that our lives can 
	and will be totally transformed, just as the disciples were on 
	that first Easter. Help us to savor the mighty power of this 
	Resurrection Day; in our risen Lord. Amen.

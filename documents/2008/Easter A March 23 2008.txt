		The Grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you. And also with you.

*CALL TO WORSHIP


		Shadows and worry follow us, clinging like cobwebs in our hair.
		Yet something has changed.
		Christ is risen!
		Christ is risen indeed!
		Darkness and grief surround us and begin to creep inside to our souls,
		But something is bright and new.
		Christ is risen!
		Christ is risen indeed!
		Denials and betrayals weaken our confidence and torment our memories,
		But forgiveness is real.
		Christ is risen!
		Christ is risen indeed!
		Confusion and doubt cloud the future and perplex the present,
		But someone is on the road with us.
		Christ is risen!
		Christ is risen indeed!

*HYMN 302
Christ the Lord Is Risen Today
EASTER HYMN
*PRAYER


		Almighty God, through your only son you overcame death and opened to us
		the gate of everlasting life. Grant that we who celebrate our Lord's
		resurrection, by 	the renewing of your Spirit, arise from the death of sin to the
		life of righteousness; through the same Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

*HYMN  322

Up from the Grave He Arose
CHRIST AROSE
*THE APOSTLES' CREED
7
I believe in God, the Father Almighty, creator of heaven and earth.
I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord, who was conceived by The Holy
Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died and
was buried: he descended to the dead. On the third day he rose again: he ascended
into heaven, is seated at the right hand of the Father, and will come again to judge the
living and the dead.
I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic church, the communion of saints,
the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting. Amen.

*HYMN 310
He Lives!
ACKLEY
*BLESSING:	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the communion of
the Holy Spirit be with you all. Amen.

* CHORAL BENEDICTION
"My Faith Still Holds"
STRONG FAITH
My faith still holds on to the Christ of Calvary, O blessed Rock of Ages cleft for me.
I gladly place my trust in things I cannot see. My faith still holds on to the Christ of
Calvary.

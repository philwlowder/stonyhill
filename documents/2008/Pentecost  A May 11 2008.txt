*CALL TO WORSHIP


	Come, believers, and faithful ones, sing your alleluias to God!
	Praise God, who invades us with the rush of a mighty wind and fills us with fire.
	Praise God, who out of love for us sent Jesus Christ to live among us.
	Praise God, whose spirit is poured out upon all flesh so our sons and daughters
might prophesy.
	God reaches into our lives and claims us, calling us honored and loved.
	We are God's people. We are redeemed, for God has called us by name.
Come, Holy Spirit, and find us in our wilderness. Lead us forth into the wonders
of your love.

WOLFE
*THE APOSTLES' CREED
7
I believe in God, the Father Almighty, creator of heaven and earth.
I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord, who was conceived by The
Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified,
died and was buried: he descended to the dead. On the third day he rose again: he
ascended into heaven, is seated at the right hand of the Father, and will come again
to judge the living and the dead.
I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic church, the communion of saints,
the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting. Amen.

* THE APOSTLES' CREED  7
Response to the Word of God
I believe in God, the Father Almighty, creator of heaven and earth.
I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord, who was conceived by The Holy 
Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died and 
was buried: he descended to the dead. On the third day he rose again: he ascended 
into heaven, is seated at the right hand of the Father, and will come again to judge the 
living and the dead. 
I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic church, the communion of saints, 
the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting. Amen.

* CHORAL BENEDICTION
"What Can I Give Him?"
CASTLE
What can I give him, poor as I am? If I were a shepherd, I would bring a lamb; 
If I were a Wise Man, I would do my part; Yet what I can I give him? Give him my heart.
*Please stand as you are able.

	1.	O how he loves you and me! O how he loves you and me!
		He gave his life, what 	more could he give?
	2.	Jesus to Calv'ry did go, his love for sinners to show.
		What he did there brought 	hope from despair.

		Refrain:	O, how he loves you, O, how he loves me, O, how he loves you and me!

WELCOME, PASSING OF THE PEW PADS, AND ANNOUNCEMENTS

*GREETING
Matthew 21:9
	Hosanna to the Son of David! Hosanna in the highest!
	Blessed is the One who comes in the name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest!

*CALL TO WORSHIP


	We gather together, waving palms of joy, waving branches of praise,
	Longing to know abiding peace in the midst of pressing worry and hurry,
	Longing to be accepted for who we are instead of being judged for not doing enough.
	We gather together, waving palms of joy, waving branches of peace,
	Hoping we are ready to walk with Jesus through the night of anguish,
	The morning of accusations, the noon of despair, the hours of darkness.
	We gather together, waving palms of joy,
	Waving branches of praise, walking toward Easter.

*HYMN 280
"All Glory, Laud, and Honor"
ST. THEODULPH

*OPENING PRAYER


	Almighty God, on this day your Son Jesus Christ entered the holy city of
Jerusalem, and was proclaimed King by those who spread their garments and
palm branches along his way. Let those branches be for us signs of his victory, and
grant 	that we who bear them in his name may ever hail him as our Lord, and
follow the 	way that leads to eternal life. In his name we pray. Amen.

*HYMN 277
"Tell Me the Stories of Jesus"
STORIES OF JESUS
*THE APOSTLES' CREED
7
I believe in God, the Father Almighty, creator of heaven and earth.
I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord, who was conceived by The
Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified,
died and was buried: he descended to the dead. On the third day he rose again: he
ascended into heaven, is seated at the right hand of the Father, and will come again
to judge the living and the dead.
I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic church, the communion of saints,
the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting. Amen.

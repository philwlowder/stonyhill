*CHORAL CALL TO WORSHIP  334
"Sweet, Sweet Spirit"
SWEET, SWEET SPIRIT
WELCOME, PASSING OF THE PEW PADS, AND ANNOUNCEMENTS

* GREETING

Psalm 121:1-2
	I lift up my eyes to the hills— from where will my help come?
	My help comes from the Lord, who made heaven and earth.

* CALL TO WORSHIP

	Faith is the conviction of realities I cannot see or feel.
	Faith is doing the right thing regardless of the consequences.
	Faith is remembering that in the kingdom of God everything is based on promise, not 
on feeling.
	Faith is confidence in God when money is running out, not rolling in.
	Faith is remembering that I am God's priceless treasure when I feel utterly worthless.
	Faith is committing the problems of loved ones to God to solve.
	Faith is remembering that I stand blameless before God, where I see nothing but my 
own meanness, pettiness, and selfishness.
	Faith is letting go of my demands that another change, and looking to God for 
the changes God sees that I need.

* HYMN  710
"Faith of Our Fathers"
ST. CATHERINE

* OPENING PRAYER


	O God, our leader and guide, strengthen our faith in your promises, that by 
your Spirit we may lift up your life to all the world through your Son, Jesus 
Christ our Savior and Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, 
one God, now and forever. Amen.

* THE APOSTLES' CREED  7
Response to the Word of God
I believe in God, the Father Almighty, creator of heaven and earth.
I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord, who was conceived by The 
Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, 
died and was buried: he descended to the dead. On the third day he rose again: he 
ascended into heaven, is seated at the right hand of the Father, and will come again 
to judge the living and the dead. 
I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic church, the communion of saints, 
the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting. Amen.

FAMILY OF GOD
	I'm so glad I'm a part of the family of God - I've been washed in the fountain,
	Cleansed by his blood. Joint heirs with Jesus as we travel this sod;
	For I'm part of the family, the family of God!

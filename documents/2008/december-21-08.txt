The Mission of Stony Hill United Methodist Church is to:
FOLLOW JESUS, MAKE DISCIPLES, AND TRANSFORM THE WORLD

Reading for the 4th Sunday of Advent
L.  Isaiah 9:6-7: "For to us a child is born, to us a son is given, and the government 
will be on his shoulders.  And he will be called Wonderful, Counselor, Mighty God 
everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.  Of the increase of his government and peace 
there will be no end.  He will reign on David's throne and over his kingdom, 
establishing and upholding it with justice and righteousness from that time on and 
forever.   The zeal of the LORD Almighty will accomplish this."
P.  We light this candle as a symbol of the Prince of Peace.  May the visitation of 
your Holy Spirit, O God, make us ready for the coming of Jesus, our hope and 
joy.  O come, O come, Emmanuel.

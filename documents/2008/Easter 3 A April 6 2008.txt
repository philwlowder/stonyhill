	The Grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you. 		And also with you.
	The risen Christ is with us!	 Praise the Lord!
*CALL TO WORSHIP


Sometimes the words and ways of God are not fully understood by us. With our
knowledge, education, and technologies, we feel that we've got our act together.

But God's will for our lives continually needs to be interpreted.
When the Scriptures are opened to our understanding, when we can recognize Jesus in
the midst of our daily lives, and when the nonsense of our struggle is explained in the
light of God's Word, our hearts are encouraged.

Christ is risen. This morning we can interpret this message in our worship and
our praise.

*PRAYER


O God, your Son makes himself known to all his disciples in the breaking of
bread. Open the eyes of our faith, that we may see him in his redeeming work,
who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever.
Amen.

"Be Thou My Vision"
SLANE
*THE APOSTLES' CREED
7
I believe in God, the Father Almighty, creator of heaven and earth.
I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord, who was conceived by The
Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified,
died and was buried: he descended to the dead. On the third day he rose again: he
ascended into heaven, is seated at the right hand of the Father, and will come again
to judge the living and the dead.
I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic church, the communion of saints,
the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting. Amen.

My faith still holds on to the Christ of Calvary,

I gladly place my trust in things I cannot see.
My faith still holds on to the Christ of Calvary.

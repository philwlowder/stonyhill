* GREETING

Isaiah 60:1
	Arise, shine, for your light has come.
	And the glory of the Lord has risen upon you.

* CALL TO WORSHIP

"I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, every hill and mountain shall be 
made low. The rough places will be made straight. The glory of the Lord shall be revealed 
and all flesh shall see it together."
	Isaiah had a dream!
"I say to you today, my friends, even though we face the difficulties of today and 
tomorrow, I still have a dream."
	Martin had a dream!
"We come from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire, the mighty mountains of New 
York, the heightening Alleghenies of Pennsylvania, the snow-capped Rockies of Colorado, 
the curvaceous slopes of California, from Stone Mountain in Georgia, Lookout Mountain in 
Tennessee, and every hill and molehill in Mississippi to let freedom ring, to remember and 
to celebrate."
	We have a dream!
"One day, all God's children will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old 
Negro spiritual: 'Free at last. Free at last. Thank God almighty, we are free at last.'"
	Thanks be to God! Hallelujah! 

* HYMN  733

* OPENING PRAYER


	Loving God, teach us to build bridges of cooperation between people of all colors, 
	creeds, and convictions. Guide us as we come together in good times as well as 
	bad. Help us to share with and to learn from each other. Be with us as we strive to 
	abide in your word. Amen.

* THE APOSTLES' CREED  7
Response to the Word of God
I believe in God, the Father Almighty, creator of heaven and earth.
I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord, who was conceived by The Holy 
Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died and 
was buried: he descended to the dead. On the third day he rose again: he ascended 
into heaven, is seated at the right hand of the Father, and will come again to judge the 
living and the dead. 
I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic church, the communion of saints, 
the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting. Amen.

*GREETING
Psalm 133:1

*HYMN 68
When in Our Music God Is Glorified
ENGELBURG

*CALL TO WORSHIP

	God sang the world into existence, and all creatures chirped or howled their praise.
	The trees clapped their hands, the mountains echoed joy,
	And rivers babbled their praise. When the melody grew faint, God sent a new singer.
	Jesus was the new song of God's love and grace –
	A sustaining grace on the darkest night,
	A persistent grace when the road is long,
	Amazing grace when we don't know where to turn.
	The song is strong; God's love goes on and on.

*HYMN 572
Pass It On
PASS IT ON

*PRAYER OF THE DAY
from Psalm 84
How lovely is your dwelling place, O Lord of hosts! Our souls long for the
refreshment of your house, where you withhold no good thing from those who
trust in you. Refresh our world-weary minds. Renew our sagging spirits with
encouragement. Lift up our hearts that we may sing with joy in your presence
and carry the music of a living God to all the earth. In the name of the Father,
Son, and Holy Spirit, Amen.

*THE APOSTLES' CREED  7

I believe in God, the Father Almighty, creator of heaven and earth.
I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord, who was conceived by The Holy
Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died and
was buried: he descended to the dead. On the third day he rose again: he ascended
into heaven, is seated at the right hand of the Father, and will come again to judge the
living and the dead.
I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic church, the communion of saints,
the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting. Amen.

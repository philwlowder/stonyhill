On this night Christians commemorate the Passover supper Jesus 
shared with his disciples before his crucifixion, when Jesus washed 
the disciples' feet and instituted the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper.

*OPENING PRAYER

Be present to us, Gracious God, in this service of tender, 
aching remembrance. Let us experience, with proper self-doubt 
and humility, the event we are commemorating: our Lord's last 
supper with his disciples.

Let us identify candidly with the confusion of the Twelve, 
their hollow protestations of fearless loyalty, even the skillful 
treachery of one of them.

Shame us once again with our Lord's courage, with his 
refusal of the sword, with his forgiveness extended both to his 
enemies and to his friends. Help us to break bread together in 
his spirit. Amen.

Helpful Scriptures for Resisting Temptation
1. 1Corinthians 10.13:  No temptation has overtaken you except 
what is common to us all. And God is faithful; he will not let you be 
tempted beyond what you can bear. But when you are tempted, he 
will also provide a way out so that you can endure it.
2. Philippians 4.13:  I can do all things through Christ who 
strengthens me.
3. Isaiah 40.29: He gives strength to the weary and increases the 
power of the weak.
4. Joshua 1.9: Have I not commanded you? Be strong and 
courageous. Do not be terrified; do not be discouraged, for the Lord 
your God will be with you wherever you go.
5. Romans 8.31: What, then, shall we say in response to this? If 
God is for us, who can be against us?
6. 1John 4.4b: the one who is in you is greater than the one who is 
in the world.
7. Hebrews 13.5: Keep your lives free from the love of money, and 
be content with what you have; for he has said, "I will never leave 
you or forsake you."
8. Hebrews 4.15-16: For we do not have a high priest who is unable 
to sympathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who has been 
tempted in every way, just as we are--yet was without sin. Let us 
then approach the throne of grace with confidence, so that we may 
receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need. 
9. John 16.33: "I have told you these things, so that in me you may 
have peace. In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have 
overcome the world."
10. Romans 8.35, 37-39: Who shall separate us from the love of 
Christ? Shall trouble or hardship or persecution or famine or 
nakedness or danger or sword?  . . . No, in all these things we are 
more than conquerors through him who loved us. For I am convinced 
that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the 
present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor 
anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love 
of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.

Isaiah 9:2
	The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light.
	Those who lived in a land of deep darkness, on them light has shined.

* CALL TO WORSHIP
Matthew 17
Upon a high mountain Jesus was transfigured and his clothes became dazzling white. From 
the cloud there came a voice, This is my Son, the Beloved; listen to him!"
The radiant glory of God shone in the Son, the power of God overshadowed him, and 
the love of God affirmed him.
Let us worship God, who creates and commands us, names and knows us, surrounds and 
sustains us.
In obedience to God, let us worship Jesus, and listen to him.

	Holy God, upon the mountain you revealed our Messiah, who by his death and 
resurrection would fulfill both the law and the prophets. By his transfiguration 
enlighten our path that we may dare to suffer with him in the service of humanity 
and so share in the everlasting glory of him who lives and reigns with you and the 
Holy Spirit, One God for ever. Amen.

* THE APOSTLES' CREED  7
Response to the Word of God
I believe in God, the Father Almighty, creator of heaven and earth.
I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord, who was conceived by The Holy 
Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died and 
was buried: he descended to the dead. On the third day he rose again: he ascended 
into heaven, is seated at the right hand of the Father, and will come again to judge the 
living and the dead. 
I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic church, the communion of saints, 
the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting. Amen.

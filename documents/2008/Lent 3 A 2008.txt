* GREETING
Psalm 95:1
		O come, let us sing to the Lord.
		Let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation!

* CALL TO WORSHIP

A song deep in the heart of God causes us to pause in the midst of hurry.
An eternal harmony breaks into our absent-minded repetition. 
A distant chorus echoing in our soul prompts us to look up and see brightness beyond a 
cloudy day, a hint of a new heaven and a new earth.
We are connected to the Eternal Parent, the Source of All Comfort.
A fragment of an eternal tune, a memory of a friend's prayer, a sudden song of a morning 
dove; all link us to our Creator.
We know we are loved with tender care, cherished with infinite patience, and carried 
on the wings of prayer. So let us sing our praise to a wondrous God.

Response to the Word of God
I believe in God, the Father Almighty, creator of heaven and earth.
I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord, who was conceived by The 
Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, 
died and was buried: he descended to the dead. On the third day he rose again: he 
ascended into heaven, is seated at the right hand of the Father, and will come again 
to judge the living and the dead. 
I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic church, the communion of saints, 
the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting. Amen.

AN ORDER OF FAREWELL TO A CHURCH MEMBER


Eunice Plyler
The church is a family. United by the common recognition of Jesus Christ as our Savior,
we are all brothers and sisters. And, for a time, Stony Hill Church is our home.
	Like every human family, our church family is formed and reformed over time.
	As members are born, as they die, as members are adopted into our family,
	and as they leave our congregation for a new home, in a different place.
For a time, Eunice Plyler has lived with us. We have shared with each other good times 
and bad, we have shared each other's joys and sorrows, we have lightened each other's 
heavy loads. Together we have laughed and cried, together we have worshiped and 
praised God, together we have lived.

Congregation:
	We feel sorrow in your leaving,
	Yet we rejoice with you in anticipation of this new phase of your life.
	We will miss your love and support, yet we know you will add much to the lives 
	of those who will be your new church family, as you have added much to our 
	lives. We will pray for you and for the whole family of God.

Let us pray together:
	O God, you are the strength and the protector of your people. We humbly place 
	into your hands Eunice Plyler of this congregation, who is about to leave us.
	Keep and preserve her, O Lord, in all health and safety, both of body and soul. 
	Through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

Eunice, Go in the peace of Christ. Our prayers go with you.	Amen.

* HYMN  672

* CHORAL BENEDICTION
"The Family of God"
FAMILY OF GOD
	I'm so glad I'm a part of the family of God - I've been washed in the fountain,
	Cleansed by his blood. Joint heirs with Jesus as we travel this sod;
	For I'm part of the family, the family of God!

WHO IS JESUS?

A Sermon Series on the gospel of John starts next Sunday, January 25, 2009!  
There's no shortage of opinions about who Jesus is.  Some say he was just a 
good teacher or a leader of a political revolution.   Some say he was a victim.  
Some say he was crazy.  But Jesus' followers know that Jesus is something 
much more: HE IS LORD AND SAVIOR OF THE WORLD!  Come each 
Sunday as we explore who Jesus is as revealed in the gospel of John, beginning 
next Sunday!

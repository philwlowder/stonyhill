Scripture for the week:  John 11:45 – 13:17

WHO IS JESUS?

Pastor Lanny continues the  Sermon Series on the gospel of John.    There's no 
shortage of opinions about who Jesus is.  Some say he was just a good teacher 
or a leader of a political revolution.   Some say he was a victim.  Some say he 
was crazy.  But Jesus' followers know that Jesus is something much more: HE 
IS LORD AND SAVIOR OF THE WORLD!  Come each Sunday as we 
explore who Jesus is as revealed in the gospel of John, continuing next 
Sunday!  

Check Out:  "Lanny's Lyrics," a spiritual journal on the church's web 
site.

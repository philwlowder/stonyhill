Stewardship Scripture: (read together) Matthew 6:19-21: "Do not store up for 
yourselves treasures on earth where moth and rust destroy and where thieves 
break in and steal.  But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moth 
and dust do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal.  For where 
your treasure is, there your heart will be also."

@ Word Music, 1986  ccli # 1358384
"Savior, again to Thy dear name we raise, With one accord our parting hymn of praise;
Once more we bless Thee ere our worship cease ;With eager hearts we wait Thy word of peace.
Grant us Thy peace upon our home-ward way; With Thee began, with Thee shall end the day
Guard Thou the lips from sin, the hearts from shame, That in this house have called upon Thy Name. 

*Stand as you are able

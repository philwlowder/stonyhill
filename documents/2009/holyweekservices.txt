*WHO IS JESUS? A Sermon Series on the gospel of John continues today!  There's no shortage of 
opinions about who Jesus is.  Some say he was just a good teacher or a leader of a political revolution.  
Some say he was a victim.  Some say he was crazy.  But Jesus' followers know that Jesus is something 
much more:  HE IS LORD AND SAVIOR OF THE WORLD!  Come each Sunday as we explore who 
Jesus is as revealed in the gospel of John!

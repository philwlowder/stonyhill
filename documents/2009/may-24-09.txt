Children's Time
Memorial Day Prayer: A Prayer for Memorial Day: Revised from A litany 
from "The Book of Worship for United States Forces" (1974)

L. Let us give thanks to God and for this land and the freedoms we enjoy here:
P. We Give You Thanks, O God.
L. For leaders in nation and state, and for those who in days past and in these present times 
have labored for the good of all:
P. We Give You Thanks, O God.
L. For those who in all times and places have been true and brave, and have lived upright lives 
and ministered to others:
P. We Give You Thanks, O God.
L. For those who served their country in its hour of need, and especially for those who gave 
even their lives in that service:
P. We Give You Thanks, O God. 
L. O almighty God and most merciful Father, we remember these your servants, we remember 
with gratitude their courage and strength and we hold before you those who mourn them.  
Look upon your bereaved servants with your mercy.  As this day brings them memories of 
those they have lost for a time, may it also bring your consolation and the assurance that all 
who have followed Christ as Lord and Savior are alive now and forever in your living 
presence.  
ALL: The Lord's Prayer     # 895

Stewardship Scripture: (read together) 2 Corinthians 8:1-3a: "And now, brothers 
and sisters, we want you to know about the grace that God has given the 
Macedonian churches.  In the midst of a very severe trial, their overflowing joy 
and their extreme poverty welled up in rich generosity.  For I testify that they 
gave as much as they were able, and even beyond their ability."

What is DISCIPLE?
DISCIPLE: BECOMING DISCIPLES THROUGH BIBLE STUDY is an approach
to Bible study that emphasizes disciplined reading of and listening
to Scripture. It results in biblically nourished persons committed to
live as disciples. During the course of 34 weeks, DISCIPLE groups move
through the Scriptures from Genesis to Revelation. All DISCIPLE Bible
study participants will read more than 70 percent of the Bible. The Scripture for
each session follows the chronological movement of the biblical
story. DISCIPLE groups consist of twelve members and a leader and meet
weekly for 2 Hours for a period of 34 weeks (nine months). Each participant
makes a commitment to daily preparation (30-45 minutes per day) and weekly
attendance at and full participation in the group study sessions. DISCIPLE aims at
transformation, not just information. DISCIPLE calls on persons to submit themselves
to examination by Scripture, to put themselves under the power of God's word, and
to be changed by God's word. Consider this opportunity to read and study the
Bible in a small, committed group and be challenged in your discipleship. If you
are interested, please fill out the interest form, detach it, and place it in the offering
plate, see Lanny, or call the church office 704-982-7211.

@ Word Music, 1986  ccli # 1358384
"Savior, again to Thy dear name we raise, With one accord our parting hymn of praise;
Once more we bless Thee ere our worship cease ;With eager hearts we wait Thy word of peace.
Grant us Thy peace upon our home-ward way; With Thee began, with Thee shall end the day
Guard Thou the lips from sin, the hearts from shame, That in this house have called upon Thy Name. 

*Stand as you are able

Scripture for the week:  John 17:1 – 19.27

WHO IS JESUS?

Pastor Lanny continues the  Sermon Series on the gospel of John.    There's no 
shortage of opinions about who Jesus is.  Some say he was just a good teacher or a 
leader of a political revolution.   Some say he was a victim.  Some say he was crazy.  
But Jesus' followers know that Jesus is something much more: HE IS LORD AND 
SAVIOR OF THE WORLD!  Come each Sunday as we explore who Jesus is as 
revealed in the gospel of John, continuing next Sunday!

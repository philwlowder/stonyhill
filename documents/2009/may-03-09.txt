WHO IS JESUS?

Pastor Lanny continues the  Sermon Series on the gospel of John.    There's no 
shortage of opinions about who Jesus is.  Some say he was just a good teacher or a 
leader of a political revolution.   Some say he was a victim.  Some say he was crazy.  
But Jesus' followers know that Jesus is something much more: HE IS LORD AND 
SAVIOR OF THE WORLD!  Come each Sunday as we explore who Jesus is as 
revealed in the gospel of John, continuing next Sunday!  



At Patty's request, Stony Hill is recruiting for a pianist.  If you know of anyone 
who might be interested, please let Pastor Lanny or the  PPR Committee know.

Stewardship Scripture: (read together) Matthew 23:23 "How terrible it will be for you 
teacher of religious law and you Pharisees.  Hypocrites!  For you are careful to tithe even 
the tiniest part of your income, but you ignore the important things of the law: justice, 
mercy, and faith.  You should tithe, yes, but you should not leave undone the more 
important things."

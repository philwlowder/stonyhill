Fourth Sunday of Advent Reading                                    Lay Reader: Becky Troutman 
L:  Isaiah 9:6-7 "For unto us a child is born, to us a son is given, and the 
government will be on his shoulders.   And he will be called Wonderful 
Counselor, Mighty God, everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.  Of the increase 
of his government and peace there will be no end.  He will reign on David's 
throne and over his kingdom, establishing and upholding it with justice and 
righteousness from that time on and forever.  The zeal of the Lord Almighty 
will accomplish this."
P: We light this candle as a symbol of the Prince of Peace.  May the 
visitation of your Holy Spirit, O God, make us ready for the coming of 
Jesus, our hope and joy.  O come, O come, Emmanuel.

The  Mission  of  Stony  Hill United  Methodist  Church  is  to:  FOLLOW    JESUS,
